-- 1. Write your own “safe” definitions of the standard partial list functions, but make
-- sure they never fail. As a hint, you might want to consider using the following types:
-- -- file: ch04/ch04.exercises.hs
-- safeHead :: [a] -> Maybe a
-- safeTail :: [a] -> Maybe [a]
-- safeLast :: [a] -> Maybe a
-- safeInit :: [a] -> Maybe [a]

safeHead :: [a] -> Maybe a
safeHead [] = Nothing
safeHead xs = Just (head xs)

safeTail :: [a] -> Maybe [a]
safeTail [] = Nothing
safeTail xs = Just (tail xs)

safeLast :: [a] -> Maybe a
safeLast [] = Nothing
safeLast xs = Just (last xs)

safeInit :: [a] -> Maybe [a]
safeInit [] = Nothing
safeInit xs = Just (init xs)
