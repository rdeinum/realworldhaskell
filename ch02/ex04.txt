3. Load your lastButOne function into ghci and try it out on lists of different lengths.
What happens when you pass it a list thatâ€™s too short?

*Main> lastButOne []
*** Exception: Empty list
CallStack (from HasCallStack):
  error, called at ex03.hs:4:22 in main:Main

*Main> lastButOne [1]
*** Exception: Only one element
CallStack (from HasCallStack):
  error, called at ex03.hs:5:22 in main:Main

*Main> lastButOne [1,2]
1

*Main> lastButOne [1,2,3]
